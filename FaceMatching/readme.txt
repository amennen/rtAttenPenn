Face Matching paradigm
* Adapted from Chai 2015 Functional and structural brain correlates of risk for major depression in children with familial depression

* Blocked-design
* Participants view a trio of images on the screen and are asked to select one of the two images on the bottom that is identical to the image on the top.
* 6 blocks for each condition, split into 2 runs, so each run has 3 blocks of each condition.
* There are 5 conditions in total for each run (Fear x3, Happy x 3, Neutral x 3, Object x 3, Fixation x 3), 15 blocks in total presented in pseudo-random order in each run. 
* So there are totally 5 conditions. Each of these 5 conditions was presented for 3 blocks within one run in pseudo-random order in each run?
* 72 actors in total are used for the 2 runs. Each actor only shows exactly 3 times, in different expressions (F, H, N), in pseudo-random order within the run.
* Actor & object repetition is controlled to be the same for each block to ensure the same level of repetition effect within each block. In addition, female vs male ratio is now equal within the block 
* Button-presses are counter-balanced within each emotional condition in each run (3 blocks). 
* 6 trials per block, 3 seconds per trial. So total run time is 4.5 minutes, 9 minutes for 2 runs. About ~10 minutes the functional scan time.
* Each run 4min 30 seg per run
* Total time 9 min total
* Data is stored in the data folder.
FaceMatching_get_conditions.py is the script to get the onsets and duration of blocks
